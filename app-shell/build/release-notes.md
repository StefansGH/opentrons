## Opentrons App Changes in 4.0.0

Opentrons App 4.0.0 is a major software release, bringing an entirely overhauled robot calibration process for the OT-2; a full switch to Opentrons Protocol API Version 2; and many look and feel improvements.

**After you install this update, you must calibrate your OT-2's pipette offsets and tip lengths before running a protocol**. This will take approximately fifteen minutes, but you will not be able to run a protocol until your OT-2 is calibrated.

## OT-2 Calibration Changes

In Opentrons App and Robot Software 4.0.0, the calibration process for the OT-2 is different and improved from major version 3. With these changes, you'll calibrate less often; the calibration processes are shorter, easier, and more reliable; and you can finally use different kinds of tips on the same pipette in the same protocol accurately.

## Full Use of Python Protocol API Version 2

We released Python Protocol API Version 2 almost a year ago, and have been continuously improving it since, with 8 new intermediate API levels, each containing bugfixes, improvements, or support for new hardware. It's ready to be the only way Python protocols are written for the OT-2. Accordingly, in 4.0.0 and subsequent releases, **the OT-2 will not accept Python Protocol API Version 1 protocols**.

## Look and Feel Changes

In 4.0.0, the Opentrons App has some major changes to the Robots tab and the Pipettes & Modules page. These changes present information about the new calibration data more concisely in a better-organized way. We hope you like it!
